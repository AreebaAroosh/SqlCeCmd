# SqlCeCmd

Administer SQL Compact databases directly from the command line, without having Visual Studio or SQL Server Management Studio installed. Only requires NetFx 2.0 and SQL Compact installed. Command line options similar to sqlcmd. Also runs any SQL Compact script files. 

Runs scripts generated by [ExportSqlCe](http://exportsqlce.codeplex.com)

The specifications (in the form of documentation on usage) for the utility is available with the current release.
